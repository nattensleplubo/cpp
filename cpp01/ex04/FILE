I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy
I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy
I'm crazy, I'm crazy
Baby, can't you see I'm messed up?
D-30 boys really next up
In this life, I'm a extra
King Nothing, I'm not special
Sweep, sweep, with the Prada's on my feet
Three, three, three, free, free from disease
Three threes, founding fathers underneath
Pretty please, baby don't bother me
Had to learn the hard way to keep my head up
If I never ate the night, I'd be fed up
I'd be bleeding really bad for the fashion
I'm too deep in the skies
Got a mask on my mask, and expense it with my life
We look down 'cause we stood upon a height
We just barely got away, but it was fine
Man, I'm fucked up in this state, and I'm trying not to let them see my face
And we one plus, from the eight
Any one of us would be burnt out at this rate
But I'm doing great
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
I'm doing great (I'm doing great)
